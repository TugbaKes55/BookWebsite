# BookWebsite

I designed a brand new website for book lovers using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap. In this project, hover, dropdown menu, shadow, card and corusel structure attract attention. You can purchase books in e-book, pdf, print copy format and download them from desktop and mobile devices. You can also watch other readers comments and find the book website's contact information!
